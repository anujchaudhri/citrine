Sampling high dimensional spaces with non-linear constraints

This software needs the following libraries in python:

1. pyDOE: https://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE/
2. NumPy
3. SciPy
4. Pathlib

To run the code:

1. Place the input file with the dimensionality and the constraints in the 'inputs' folder
2. Run the following at the prompt: python3 main.py <input_filename> <output_filename> <number_of_samples>
3. Check the output in the 'outputs' folder
